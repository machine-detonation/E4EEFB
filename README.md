1. The discourse around touch trigger/discomfort and crowd/cuddle discomfort is so weird to me. Even if this is a pixel pony game boundaries can still exist.. if someone doesn't wanna be touched, then respect their wishes?? It is TRULY not that serious that you need to put them in your DNI or say it's delusional/not real



2. Putting an entire fandom in your dni because of a loud minority of the community/drama that happened is genuinely so stupid.. every fandom has weird fans and drama is inevitable. (if the source media itself is problematic (***COUGH COUGH, THE COFFIN OF ANDREW AND LEYLEY***) then this doesn't count)



3. Kids SHOULD be allowed on internet as long as they stay in kids spaces. The reason why the Internet isn't super safe for kids is because people keep promoting adult content in spaces that clearly are not meant for adult content (*I.E, My Little Pony, Roblox as a whole, etc*). Don't blame the kids, blame the people who are ruining kids spaces. this is a bit of an unpopular opinion and it upsets me so much omfg
